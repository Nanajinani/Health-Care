<h2>Our Transformation approach</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health care Transformation is designed around 3 strategic objectives and supported by 7 major areas of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, we are focusing Health care's work on driving impact at country level and embedding our mission and strategy in our day-to-day work and organizational culture. This work includes the workstreams focused on establishing and operationalizing an impact-focused, data-driven strategy and a new results-focused, collaborative culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, we are establishing a fit-for-purpose organization to deliver our mission and strategy, anchored in new ways of working that are enabled by “best-in-class” processes and an aligned, 3-level operating model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And third, we are leveraging our partners and the global community to drive health outcomes, including through new partnership and resource mobilization initiatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Underpinning all of these objectives is our work to ensure that we have a diverse, motivated and fit-for-purpose workforce.</p>
